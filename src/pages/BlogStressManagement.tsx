              </h1>
              
              <p className="text-xl text-muted-foreground">
                After 20 years studying stress and the brain, I've learned that the difference between thriving and barely surviving isn't about avoiding stress it's about building a brain that can handle anything life throws at it.
              </p>
            </div>

            <Card className="p-6 mb-8">
              <p className="text-foreground">
                Last week, I watched two CEOs handle identical crisis situations. One had a panic attack. The other stayed calm and led his team to a breakthrough solution. The difference? One had a stress-optimized brain, the other didn't. Here's how to build yours.
              </p>
            </Card>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">The Stress Paradox: Your Brain's Double-Edged Sword</h2>
            
            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              Here's what most people get wrong about stress: it's not the enemy. Acute stress is actually performance-enhancing it sharpens focus, boosts memory, and increases physical strength.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              The problem is chronic stress. When your brain stays in high-alert mode for weeks or months, it literally rewires itself in destructive ways.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground mb-6">
              <strong>The neuroscience:</strong> Chronic stress floods your brain with cortisol, shrinking the prefrontal cortex (your rational brain) while enlarging the amygdala (your fear center). You become more reactive and less thoughtful.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">The Stress-Brain Hijack: What's Really Happening</h2>
            
            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              When you're chronically stressed, your brain gets stuck in what I call "survival mode." It prioritizes immediate threats over long-term thinking, making it nearly impossible to be creative or strategic.
            </p>

            <Card className="p-6 mb-6">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">The Hijacked Brain Checklist</h3>
              <p className="text-foreground mb-2">You know your brain is hijacked when you experience:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-foreground space-y-1">
                <li>Racing thoughts that won't stop</li>
                <li>Difficulty making simple decisions</li>
                <li>Snapping at people over minor issues</li>
                <li>Forgetting important details</li>
                <li>Feeling overwhelmed by normal tasks</li>
              </ul>
            </Card>

            <p className="text-foreground mb-6">
              <strong>The good news:</strong> Your brain is remarkably plastic. With the right techniques, you can literally rebuild neural pathways for resilience.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">The CALM Protocol: Rewiring Your Stress Response</h2>
            
            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              I've developed a four-step protocol that's been tested with everyone from emergency room doctors to Navy SEALs. It works because it targets the specific brain circuits involved in stress.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-3">C - Cognitive Reframing</h3>
            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              Your brain's interpretation of events matters more than the events themselves. When you reframe stress as a challenge rather than a threat, your physiology actually changes.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              <strong>The technique:</strong> When you feel stressed, ask yourself: "How can this situation help me grow?" This simple shift activates the prefrontal cortex and reduces amygdala activation.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-3">A - Autonomic Regulation</h3>
            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              Your breathing controls your nervous system. Most people breathe too shallow when stressed, keeping their brain in fight-or-flight mode.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              <strong>The 4-7-8 Reset:</strong> Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Do this 3 times. It activates your parasympathetic nervous system, literally switching your brain from stress mode to calm mode.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-3">L - Limbic Soothing</h3>
            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              Your limbic system (emotional brain) responds to sensory input. You can hack this system to instantly calm your mind.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              <strong>My go-to techniques:</strong> Splash cold water on your face (activates the diving reflex), listen to calming music, or practice progressive muscle relaxation starting from your toes.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-3">M - Mindful Anchoring</h3>
            <p className="text-foreground mb-6">
              When your mind is racing, anchor it to the present moment. This breaks the cycle of catastrophic thinking that fuels chronic stress.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground mb-6">
              <strong>The 5-4-3-2-1 technique:</strong> Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste. This grounds your brain in reality instead of imagined threats.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">Building Long-Term Stress Resilience</h2>
            
            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              The CALM protocol works for acute stress, but building lasting resilience requires rewiring your brain at a deeper level.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-3">Stress Inoculation Training</h3>
            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              Just like vaccines expose you to small amounts of pathogens to build immunity, stress inoculation exposes you to manageable stress to build resilience.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              <strong>How to practice:</strong> Deliberately engage in challenging but manageable activities—cold showers, public speaking, intense workouts. Your brain learns that stress is temporary and survivable.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-3">The Recovery Ritual</h3>
            <p className="text-foreground mb-6">
              Elite performers aren't just good at handling stress—they're excellent at recovering from it. They have specific rituals that help their nervous system reset.
            </p>

            <Card className="p-6 mb-8">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">My Personal Recovery Stack</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-foreground space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Physical:</strong> 10 minutes of walking outside (nature reduces cortisol by 15%)</li>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">The Neurobiology of Stress Mastery</h2>
            
            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              When you consistently practice stress management techniques, your brain physically changes:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-foreground mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Prefrontal cortex strengthens:</strong> Better decision-making and emotional control</li>
              <li><strong>Amygdala shrinks:</strong> Reduced reactivity to triggers</li>
              <li><strong>Hippocampus grows:</strong> Improved memory and learning</li>
              <li><strong>Neural connections optimize:</strong> Faster recovery from stressful events</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">The High-Performance Stress Mindset</h2>
            
            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              Top performers don't avoid stress—they optimize their response to it. They've trained their brains to see stress as fuel for peak performance.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground mb-4">
              <strong>The mindset shift:</strong> Instead of "I'm so stressed," think "I'm so energized." Research shows this simple reframe improves performance by up to 23%.
